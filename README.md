# Progressive-Web-Applications-PWA-Challenge-Text-Editor

## Overview

This project creates a text editor web application that allows developers to create and manage notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection. The application is designed to be reliable for retrieving stored content for later use, providing a seamless experience for developers.

## Features

- **Offline Support**: Users can create and access notes or code snippets even without an internet connection.
- **Client-Server Folder Structure**: Upon opening the application in a text editor, users will find a structured folder system for both client and server components.
- **Easy Setup**: Running `npm run start` from the root directory starts the backend and serves the client, simplifying the setup process.
- **Webpack Bundling**: JavaScript files are bundled using webpack, ensuring efficient code organization and optimization.
- **Generated Files**: Webpack plugins generate HTML files, service workers, and a manifest file to enhance the application's functionality.
- **Compatibility with Next-Gen JavaScript**: The application supports the use of next-generation JavaScript features, ensuring smooth functionality without errors.
- **IndexedDB Integration**: IndexedDB immediately creates a database storage upon opening the text editor, enabling seamless content saving and retrieval.
- **Content Persistence**: Content entered in the text editor is automatically saved in IndexedDB when the user clicks off the DOM window, ensuring no data loss.
- **Installable Application**: Users can download the web application as an icon on their desktop by clicking the Install button.
- **Service Worker Registration**: Upon loading the application, a service worker is registered using workbox, enabling offline access and caching of static assets.
- **Render Deployment**: Proper build scripts are included for deploying the application to Render, ensuring smooth deployment and operation in a production environment.
